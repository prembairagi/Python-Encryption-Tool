# Python-Encryption-Tool
A secure tool for demonstrating cryptographic principles and protecting data using the [Specify Algorithm] cipher.
# 🔐 Secure Encryption Tool (Algorithm Used: [Specify Algorithm, e.g., AES, XOR, Caesar])

## Overview
This application provides a hands-on demonstration of cryptographic principles by offering robust encryption and decryption capabilities. It is designed to secure sensitive data, emphasizing the practical implementation of modern encryption standards.

## ✨ Features
* **Two-Way Functionality:** Supports both encryption and decryption of data/files.
* **Secure Key Management:** Implements basic key handling/generation ([Specify how, e.g., user-input, simple derivation]).
* **Algorithm Implementation:** Successfully implemented the **[Specify Algorithm]** cipher from scratch/using standard libraries (e.g., PyCryptodome).
* **Technical Stack:** Python 3.x, focused on cryptographic integrity and operational security.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup
1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🖥️ Usage
To encrypt or decrypt a file/string:
```bash
# Example command for file encryption
python encryption_tool.py --encrypt [input_file] [output_file] [key] 
# (Customize the usage example to match your tool's actual command line interface)
